          <h2>About the Alumni Christmas Raffle</h2>
          <p>
            As part of our efforts to bring our community together and give back to our school,
            we are organising our very First Annual Alumni Christmas Raffle!
          </p>
          <p>
            One of the things that makes this raffle so incredibly special is that almost all the
            donors are alumni or alumni owned/affiliated companies! The members of our wide
            network of alumni have given so generously to support our initiative by donating
            vouchers, products or services to be included as prizes in our raffle. To them, we
            give our deepest thanks and gratitude.
          </p>
          <p>
            The proceeds from the raffle will go directly towards supporting the Alumni
            Association’s work as an educational charity, funding school initiatives, including
            the Forest School, and contributing to other charitable causes that benefit our
            broader community.
          </p>
          <p>
            Thank you for supporting the Alumni Association as we strive to reflect and
            strengthen the values of education, community and generosity that our school so
            tirelessly continues to uphold.
