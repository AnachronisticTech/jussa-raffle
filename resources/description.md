# The Junior & Senior School Alumni Association

As part of our efforts to bring our community together and give back to our school, we are organising our very First Annual Alumni Christmas Raffle!

One of the things that makes this raffle so incredibly special is that almost all the donors are alumni or alumi owned/affiliated companies! The members of our wide network of alumni have given so generously to support our initiative by donating vouchers, products or services to be included as prizes in our raffle. To them, we give our deepest thanks and gratitude.

The proceeds from the raffle will go directly towards supporting the Alumni Associationâ€™s work as an educational charity, funding school initiatives, including the Forest School, and contributing to other charitable causes that benefit our broader community.

Thank you for supporting the Alumni Association as we strive to reflect and strengthen the values of education, community and generosity that our school so tirelessly continues to uphold.
